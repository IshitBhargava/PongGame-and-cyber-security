 
# Learn how to teach cyber security while a playing a Computer vs Player PONG game!

# STEPS: 
<pre>
step 1: install python IDLE if not installed (you can also configure python in VS code to run this code)
step 2: install the needed libraries by writing the following lines of code in terminal:
</pre>
<pre>
<code>
pip install pygame
pip install sys
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
after installing this, then download the code file and run it.
If it shows any error, then there is a library error (most likely)
But, if it works then input the default values that it asks. 
After this, a new tab should appear where you can pong using up and down arrow keys.
If you miss the paddle, then it will pause the game and ask a question on the tab on which you entered the values. if the answer for the question is correct, then it will resume the game after 10 seconds (if the screen freezes/ says 'not reponding' , it is normal)
If the answer is wrong, then it will close the game and tell you your score. 
</pre>
